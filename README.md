## Purpose
This is the first ever Android program I made. My goal with this project was to learn as much as I could and to be able to 
think of a concept and make it a reality. Given this was the case, I did not focus on making it exactly readable and did 
not follow good coding practices. This project started as a simple score keeper app and I just kept adding more and more 
features and I am happy with what I have so far.
